# Project Euler solutions
This is a repository for my personal project Euler problem solutions. Currently all solutions are written in C.

### Setup
To compile and run any solution, use the included script:
```
./run <num> <arg>
```
where  `<num>` is the Project euler problem number and `<arg>` is an optional numeric argument which most of the solutions can use in their respective calculations instead of the official task default.

If using the script, make sure you have `python` and `gcc` installed.

### Directory layout
The solutions are located in `/solutions`, with each solution having it's own directory named according to it's respective Project Euler problem ID.
